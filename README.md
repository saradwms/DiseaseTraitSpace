# NSF EAGER: Immunity to Community: Can Quantifying Immune Traits Inform Reef Community Structure?

Principle Investigators: Laura Mydlarz, Erinn Muller, Marilyn Brandt.

Analysis and code by Sara Williams

This project has 3 main goals:
- Goal 1: Determine variability of coral immune traits in several common coral species found on Caribbean reefs. 

- Goal 2: Determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in coral. 

- Goal 3: Develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits.

Analyses and code in this repository are for Goal 3.
